GPTMysite is an open-source, no-code development platform for creating chatbots and conversational apps. Our Design Studio, featured in this repository, offers a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface with pre-ready actions and integrations. This platform combines the power of LLM/GPT AI with a flexible 'graph' approach for creating conversations and automations with ease.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.
